# SampleCoffeeShopApi
Just a sample API for a fictional coffee shop and no real functionality.

The API is defined in two files: one using Swagger and the other using RAML. A tool was used to convert between the formats.

The Visual Studio project includes a sample implementation of this API that for the most part was auto-generated using a RAML Visual Studio.
A few of the API methods were manually updated to stub out a fictional implementation to demonstrate caching, authorization, returning data and different response codes.

For a more interactive (but not functional) and visual representation of the API you can use the Swagger API definition and the tool at http://editor.swagger.io/.
